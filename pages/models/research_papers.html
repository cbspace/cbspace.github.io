    <h1>Research Papers</h1>  
    <p>
    It is a good idea to read research papers when learning AI as they provide good explanations and are free to access.
    Most AI research papers are stored on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> which is an open access platform.
    <p>
    I have listed some popular papers however the list is nowhere near exhaustive. There has been an explosion of new papers
    recently and it can be difficult to keep up with the latest developments. It's still good to read the older papers to
    get an idea of where the latest AI developments have come from. A lot of new papers also build upon previous works.
    <p>
    <h2>Transformers</h2>
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a><br>
    This groundbreaking paper from 2017 introduced the Transformer model. This is what begun the developments of the powerful
    GPT models that we see used in LLMs today.
