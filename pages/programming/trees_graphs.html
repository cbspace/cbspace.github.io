    <h1>Trees and Graphs</h1>
    <p>
    Trees and graphs are import programming data structures that have many uses and applications. To begin with I will
    go through a tree example an associated C++ code. The code example below is a solution for a question in 
    "Cracking the Code Interview" which asks:
    <p>
    <i><b>4.1 Route Between Nodes:</b> Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a
    route between two nodes.</i>
    <p>
    I have created a simple graph with 6 nodes that are initially separated but can be joined with a flag. The below 
    diagram shows the graph with directional connections in blue and the found path between nodes 0 and 5 in red.
    <p>

    <h2>My Solution for the Route Between Nodes Problem</h2>
    First some boilerplate for C++. I'm making use of the standard library headers and then adding the using statments for
    the elements that I require. This practice avoids namespace pollution and allows the types to be used without scoping
    (e.g. <code>std::string my_string;</code> becomes <code>string my_string;</code>).
    <p>
<codeblock class="cpp">
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;queue&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

using std::vector;
using std::queue;
using std::string;
using std::shared_ptr;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::make_shared;
</codeblock>
<p>
Now to define the Node class for the directed graph. The name field contains the Node
number, the vector node_list contains pointers to all the connected nodes and bool 
visited is used in the algorithm to keep track of visited nodes. I'm wrapping the Node
pointers in a shared_ptr to improvement memory management.
<p>
The constructor uses an initialiser list to set the name and set visited to false upon 
creation.
<p>
<codeblock class="cpp">
// Directed Graph
class Node { 
    public: 
        int name;
        vector&lt;shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt;&gt; node_list;
        bool visited;

        Node(int name) : name(name), visited(false) {}
        
        void append(shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; new_node) {
            node_list.emplace_back(new_node);
        }
};
</codeblock>
<p>
The function below is used to create the graph shown in the diagram above. First a loop is used
to create all the nodes using dynamic allocation. After that the node connections are defined.
There is a flag called add_connection that adds the connection between nodes 2 and 4 when set
to true.
<p>
It's worth noting that accessing the node elements using the <code>[]</code> notation could be altered to Use
the .at method instead. This would be a safer way to do it. I.e <code>nodes.at(0)->append(nodes.at(1));</code>
I have used the bracket notation for readability in this example.
<p>
<codeblock class="cpp">
// Create graph and return parent pointer
shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; create_graph(bool add_connection) {
    const int graph_size = 6;
    auto nodes = vector&lt;shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt;&gt;();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; graph_size; i++) {
        nodes.emplace_back(make_shared&lt;Node&gt;(i));
    }

    nodes[0]-&gt;append(nodes[1]);
    nodes[1]-&gt;append(nodes[2]);
    nodes[2]-&gt;append(nodes[0]);
    nodes[3]-&gt;append(nodes[5]);
    nodes[5]-&gt;append(nodes[4]);
    nodes[4]-&gt;append(nodes[3]);
    
    if (add_connection) {
        nodes[2]-&gt;append(nodes[4]);
    }

    return nodes[0];
}
</codeblock>
<p>
The route_between_nodes function is where the action happens. This function
takes in a pointer to the inital node in the search (n1) as well as an integer
name for the desired end node (n2). It would have been nice to have both parameters
be a pointer or an int however that would require a search function to be added
in order to get the reference to a node based in it's name.
<p>
The algorithm is based on a Depth First Search and uses a queue to keep track of
neighbour nodes to visit. A while loop is used to search the remaining Node references
that are stored in the queue. If the desired end point is found the loop is broken
and the function returns true. If the desired end node is not found the neighbours
of the current node are iterated over and added to the queue.
<p>
It's important to keep track of which nodes have been visited so that infinite cycles
do not occur. A node is set to visited at the beginning of the while loop and then
the visited flags are checked for each neighbour before adding neighbour nodes to the
queue.
<p>
<codeblock class="cpp">
// Use a BFS to find if there is a route between nodes
bool route_between_nodes(shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; n1, int n2) {
    bool route_detected = false;
    auto q = queue&lt;shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt;&gt;();
    q.push(n1);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; current_node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        current_node-&gt;visited = true;
        cout &lt;&lt; "* Visited " &lt;&lt; current_node-&gt;name &lt;&lt; endl;

        if (current_node-&gt;name == n2) {
            route_detected = true;
            break;
        }

        for (shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; neighbour : current_node-&gt;node_list) {
            if (!neighbour-&gt;visited) {
                q.push(neighbour);
            }
        }
    }

    return route_detected;
}
</codeblock>
<p>
The main function is used to run the tests for the algorithm. It is first run with the flag set to false which
creates the non-connected graph. Then the flag is set to true and the program is run again to produce the second
output which finds the path between node 0 and node 5.
<p>
<codeblock class="cpp">
// Program to test algorithm
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; parent = create_graph(true);

    cout &lt;&lt; "Searching for route between nodes 0 and 5:" &lt;&lt; endl;

    string route_is_found = "False";
    if (route_between_nodes(parent, 5)) {
        route_is_found = "True";
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Route found: " &lt;&lt; route_is_found &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</codeblock>
    <p>
    First the program is tested without the link between nodes 2 and 4 added. The output of the program is:
    
    <codeblock style="margin-top: 20; padding-top: 16; padding-bottom: 16;">Searching for route between nodes 0 and 5:
* Visited 0
* Visited 1
* Visited 2
Route found: False</codeblock>
    <p>
    Next, the link between nodes 2 and 4 is added. The output of the program is:
<codeblock style="margin-top: 20; padding-top: 16; padding-bottom: 16;">Searching for route between nodes 0 and 5:
* Visited 0
* Visited 1
* Visited 2
* Visited 4
* Visited 3
* Visited 5
Route found: True</codeblock>
    <p>
    The code is working as expected! Further improvements could be made such as the use of weak pointers to avoide circular references
    and the inclusion of error handling.
