    <h1>GIT Version Control</h1>
    <p>
    Git is a commonly used version control tool for managing software source code files. Git is capable of managing
    any file type including binary files. It's efficient in terms of storage as it only tracks the deltas for modified 
    files. A Git history (stored in ".git" directories) contains all previous modification states and allows full
    history tracking and recovery.
    <p>
    Github is the most common online Git repository service and is free to access. Web based repositories and known
    as "remote" repositories in Git terminology. There are GUI based Git tools and tools integrated into IDEs that
    provide easy access to beginners. For example VSCode contains Git functionality by default. For people who prefer
    command line functionality Git has you covered. I personally prefer to use Git via the command-line interface (CLI).
    <p>
    The following command-line instructions are the mostly used Git commands that you should get familiar with. 
    Even if you prefer to use a GUI application it's beneficial to learn these as it's a great way to become familiar
    with the Git workflow and terminology.

        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
        The Git config tool can be opened by typing <code class="inline">git config</code> at the command-line. 
        To view the config use <code class="inline">git config --list</code>. The following are some useful commands.
        <p>
        Setting username and email:<br>
        <code class="inline">git config --global user.name "My Name"<br>
        git config --global user.email myname@mydomain.com</code>
        <p>
        To set up the default text editor (for example Notepad++ on Windows):<br>
        <code class="inline">git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' <br>-multiInst -nosession"</code>

        <h2>Clone a Repository</h2>
        <p>
        To clone an existing repository from Github use the <code class="inline">clone</code> command. This will copy
        the repository into the current directory under a new directory with the same name as the repository name.<br>
        <code class="inline">git clone https://github.com/myname/myrepo.git</code>
        
        <h2>Create New Local Repository</h2>
        <p>
        <code class="inline">git init</code> To initialise a repository based from the current directory and create a .git directory.<br>

        <h2>Adding Files to a Commit</h2>
        <p>
        A "commit" in Git terminology refers to a collection of file altertations. When creating a new repository you would most likely
        create a commit containing all the relevant files. When modifying an existing an existing repository you would create individual
        commits for each related set of changes.
        <p>
        <code class="inline">git add *</code> This will add all files and all file modifications in the current directory to the next 
        Git commit A .gitignore file should can be used to specify which files or file types you do not wish to add.
        <p>
        If you only wish to commit individual files or individual modifications you can specify filenames:<br>
        <code>git add &lt;filenames&gt;</code>
        <p>
        A handy feature is to use the git add command with the -p flag which will prompt you for every alteration whether or not to add the
        alteration to the next commit. This is useful if you have made multiple alterations and wish to add them to more than one commit. 
        See the breakdown of options <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085162/commit-only-part-of-a-files-changes-in-git" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        <code>git add -p</code>
        <p>
        After adding files or modifications to a commit you can create the commit with the <code>git commit</code>command. The -a flag
        is used when you wish to add all tracked file modifications to the commit. It can be omitted if you have already added modifications
        using the git add command. The -m flag stands for "message" and allows you to add a description for the commit.<br>
        <code class="inline">git commit -am "First commit"</code> 
        <p>
        When you are ready to upload your location repository to Github you will need to add a "remote". This tells Git the location of
        the remote repository.<br>
        <code class="inline">git remote add origin https://github.com/myname/myrepo.git</code>
        <p>
        If you wish to remove a remote location you can use:<br>
        <code class="inline">git remote rm origin</code>

        <h2>Update Local to Match Remote</h2>
        <p>
        A git pull command will fetch data from the remote location (eg.Github) and merge it with the local files. It's a 
        good idea to do a pull request before working on some files, to make sure your base files match remote. This is 
        especially important if working from multiple PCs.
        <p>
        <code class="inline">git pull &lt;remote&gt;</code>
        
        <h2>Update Remote to Match Local</h2>
        <p>
        Now the moment all the hard work has lead to! To "push" you files and changes to the remote location use <code>git push</code>.
        The "main" location specified here is the branch name. Git will use main as the default however it's possible to rename it. It's
        also possible to add multiple branches when adding new features to your application.<br>
        <code class="inline">git push -u origin main</code> 
        <!-- <p>
        <code class="inline">git rebase --interactive HEAD~2</code> would combine the previous 2 commits
        -->
        <h2>Restore Local files</h2>
        <p>
        The <code class="inline">git checkout</code> command can be used to restore local files to match the Master branch. 
        This is useful if a local file is unintentionally deleted or modified and you do not wish to commit these changes. 
        For this command to work the changes must not be staged/committed. You can use <code class="inline">git status</code> 
        to check if the changes are staged.
        <p>
        <code class="inline">git checkout -- &lt;file(s)&gt;</code>
