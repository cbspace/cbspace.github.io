    <h1>PyTorch</h1>
    <p>
    PyTorch is the most popular AI programming libary at the moment. It's a free and open source Python libary which
    has support for a large array of AI model components. PyTorch is fast and efficient due to it's C++ backend as well
    as GPU acceleration via NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm. Installation on Linux is straighforward and can be done with a single 
    command. The only difficulty is ensuring that you install the version that is compatible with your OS and version of 
    CUDA/ROCm. 
    <p>
    <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" target="_blank">This page</a> on the PyTorch website has you covered for 
    installation on Linux, Windows and Mac. You will need to either choose a package manager such as Conda or Pip or install
    from source. If you wish to use Conda see my <a href="anaconda_setup.html" target="_parent">Ananconda Setup</a> notes.
