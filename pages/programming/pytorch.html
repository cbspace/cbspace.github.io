    <h1>PyTorch</h1>
    <p>
    PyTorch is the most popular AI programming libary at the moment. It's a free and open source Python libary which
    has support for a large array of AI model components. PyTorch is fast and efficient due to it's C++ backend as well
    as GPU acceleration via NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm. Installation on Linux is straighforward and can be done with a single 
    command. The only difficulty is ensuring that you install the version that is compatible with your OS and version of 
    CUDA/ROCm. 
    <p>
    <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" target="_blank">This page</a> on the PyTorch website has you covered for 
    installation on Linux, Windows and Mac. You will need to either choose a package manager such as Conda or Pip or install
    from source. If you wish to use Conda see my <a href="anaconda_setup.html" target="_parent">Ananconda Setup</a> notes.

    <h2>Sample code for an MLP Classifier Model</h2>
<codeblock class="python">
from torch import nn

class BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
      super().__init__()

      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
      self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
      self.activation = nn.Sigmoid()

  def forward(self, x):
      x = self.fc1(x)
      x = self.fc2(x)
      x = self.activation(x)
      return x
</codeblock>
    <p>
    This code defines a binary classifier model using the PyTorch Neural Network (nn) module. A binary classifier is a network
    which takes N inputs and has a single output between 0 and 1 which specifies the probability that the inputs represent a 
    particular class. For example the inputs could be the grades for assignments and exams for a university course and the output
    would represent the probability of the student passing the course.
    <p>
    The layers of the Neural Network and the activation functions are defined and wrapped in a class. The class inherits from the 
    <code>nn.Module</code> class in order to provide the desired neural network functionality. The init method has 2 parameters 
    which specity the number of inputs and the number of hidden neurons.
    <p>
    The first line in the init method calls <code>super().__init__()</code> which performs the initialistion of the nn module. Then
    we define the fc1 and fc2 fully-connected layers and pass in the number of inputs and outputs for each layer. Finally the activation
    function is defined which in this case is the Sigmoid function which will compress the output values of the neural network to between
    0 and 1.
    <p>
    The forward method defines the behavior of a forward pass through the neural network. Forward passes are used during training the 
    network and for performing inference on a trained network. The method takes in the inputs (typically denoted as 'x') and then runs them
    through the fully-connected layers and activation function. The output of the forward method is the prediction which in this case is
    a value between 0 and 1.
    <p>
    Usually training of neural networks is performed in batches rather than sigle inputs. What this means is that PyTorch nn modules and
    associated methods can take in either single values or arrays of values. The batching simply adds an additional dimension to the beginning
    of the input tensor. For example if performing predictions for an entire class of students the input tensor when calling the forward method
    could be of dimension [students, input_size] and the output would be of size [students, 1].
