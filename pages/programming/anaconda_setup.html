    <h1>Anaconda Setup</h1>
    <p>
    Anaconda is a great package management tool for, especially for Python based AI projects. Package management is required due to
    the differing package dependencies for various AI tools and libraries. Ananconda allows you to create different environments
    which have a different set of packages and versions.
    <p>
    For example you man need CUDA 11.8 and torch 1.8 for a particular application and another man require CUDA 12.4 and torch 2.0.1. 
    Having separate virtual environments allows this different configurations to exist on the same machine. The following instructions 
    will assist in installing and using Ananconda.

      <p>
      Installing conda:<br>
      <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html" target="_blank">Conda Installation Guide</a>
      <p>
      Creating a virtual environment (optional python version shown in braces):<br>
      <code>conda create -n [env_name] {python=3.11}</code>
      <p>
      Listing virtual environments:<br>
      <code>conda env list</code>
      <p>
      Removing a virtual environment:<br>
      <code>conda remove --name [env_name] --all</code>
      <p>
      Activating a virtual environment:<br>
      <code>source activate [env_name]</code>
      <p>
      Deactivating a virtual environment:<br>
      <code>conda deactivate</code>
      <p>
      Exporting a virtual environment (saved to enviornment.yaml):<br>
      <code>conda env export &gt environment.yaml</code>
      <p>
      Creating a virtual environment from a file (imported from enviornment.yaml):<br>
      <code>conda env create -f environment.yaml</code>
      <p>
      Installing packages:<br>
      <code>conda install [package_name]</code><br>
      This will install the latest version of the package available in the conda channels. 
      I have found that installing packages with PIP usually provides newer package versions and results
      in less conflicts so I recommend it over conda for installations. Simply replace conda in the 
      command above with pip.
      <p>
      To install a particular version of a package use:
      <code>conda install [package_name]=[version]</code><br>
      <p>
      List installed packages:<br>
      <code>conda list  </code><br>
      This will also list packages installed with pypi (via the pip install commdand). These packages
      will have pypi listed as the channel.
      <p>
      Adding channels:<br>
      Channels allow for additions package sources. One of the most common is conda-forge which will be 
      reqiuired for some packages.<br>
      <code>conda config --add channels conda-forge</code>
      <p>
      Configure conda to not run the base environment when opening the terminal:<br>
      <code>conda config --set auto_activate_base false</code>

      <h2>Tips for Package Management</h2>
      <p>
      If you run into version conflicts with packages and binaries the first thing to check is the path
      that is being used. This can be done with the which command. For example if you have a conflict with
      the gcc version you can use this command to check which gcc is being used:<br>
      <code>which gcc</code><br>
      If the outputted path is /usr/bin/package it means conda is targetting the default system installation
      (probably due to that particular package not being intstalled in the current conda environment). If the path
      is /home/user/miniconda3/envs/env_name/bin/package then the package being targeted is installed in the conda
      environment. If you need to install another version of the package use "conda install package_name=version".
