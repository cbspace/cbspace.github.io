    <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>
    Neural Networks are the building blocks of all AI models. There are various types of Neural Networks however the fundamentals are mostly the same.
    The most basic neural network consists of a row of "neurons" which connect an input value to an output. The neuron in the middle stores information
    which is used to learn a representaion that maps the input to the output. 
    <p>
    Neural Networks are "trained" on data to "learn" the optimal values for the parameters in the network. Once fully trained the Neural Network can be
    given any input and that input is tranformed into a "prediction" by the network.
