      <div class="linkbold" style="color: #dbd5a1">NVIDIA Unveils fVDB to Build Photorealistic 3D World Models</div>
      <div class="subtitle">31/07/2024 7pm AEST</div>
      fVDB (Floating-Point Volume/Voxel Data Base) is an extension to the OpenVDB standard which is used to store sparse 
      volumetric data. This new framework allows for large and high resolution 3D scenes to be created and used for deep 
      learning tasks on 3D data. Applications include self driving cars, environment simulations, high resolution 3D image generation 
      and many more.
      <p>
      The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/fvdb-bigger-digital-models/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from NVIDIA
      contains some videos which show realistic 3D city environments creted from spatial data. NVIDIA have also released 
      a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01781" target="_blank">paper</a> which details fVDB.
      
      <div class="linkbold" style="color: #dbd5a1">Meta Release Llama 3.1 Open Weights Models</div>
      <div class="subtitle">24/07/2024 8pm AEST</div>
      Meta have released their Llama 3.1 series (referred to as a "herd") of open-weight models and their performance is nothing 
      short of stunning. The largest model has 405B parameters and can outperform GPT 4o in many tasks. Also released were
      8B parameter and 70B parameter models as well as "instruct" versions. The instruct versions are capable of tool usage
      and can be use for AI agents.
      <p>
      Lllama 3.1 models are licenced under a new agreement which allows "distillation" which means you can train smaller models 
      and generate synthetic data using Llama 3.1. The Llama model licence also allows commercial use. The announcement was 
      accompanied by a detailed <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/" target="_blank">paper</a>
      which outlines the design and training of the models.
